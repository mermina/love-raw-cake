"""
check-assets.py — make sure every file the site references is actually committed.

Scans HTML, CSS and JS for local asset references and reports any that are
missing from disk or missing from git. Run before every push:

    python3 check-assets.py

Exit code 0 = everything resolves. 1 = something is missing.

Why this exists: the site was published three times with files missing, because
each hand-rolled check looked in one place and the references lived in another.

  - styles.css and site.js were missed  — the check only looked at <img src>
  - the 8 hero images were missed       — they load via CSS background-image
  - the 22 gallery images were missed   — they live in a JS array

Nothing is scanned by hand any more. This looks everywhere.
